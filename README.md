[![Bitdeli Badge](https://d2weczhvl823v0.cloudfront.net/wmichelin/bookmarkhotkeys/trend.png)](https://bitdeli.com/free "Bitdeli Badge")

This project was created for fun, as well as to try and better understand the React.js framework. Along the way, I inadvertantly learned about using

* [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
* [browserify](http://browserify.org/)
* [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html)
* [watchify](https://github.com/substack/watchify)
* [reactify](https://github.com/andreypopp/reactify)
* and much more!

##Future Plans
I had an absolute blast making this, and it's still pretty rough, but I would love to add support for

* Creating and persisting playlists
* Importing spotify playlists
* Creating a persistent music library (Spotify-esque)
* General architectural improvements

##Installation
Need to have git installed.  
Enter the following commands:

```
> git clone https://github.com/wmichelin/YoutubeMusicPlayer.git         
> cd YouTubeMusicPlayer   
> npm install
> http-server
```

In a new tab, enter the following:

```   
> gulp   
```

If you'd like to set up livereload, to modify CSS without reloading the page, enter the following in a new tab:

```
> livereload
```

Checkout [livereload](http://livereload.com/) to learn more about livereload (It's a pretty cool library).

Hope you enjoy! Make a PR or open an issue if you have any ideas
